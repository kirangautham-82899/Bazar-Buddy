# ðŸ›’ Bazar-Buddy: Empowering Street Vendors with Hyperlocal Raw Material Aggregation

-----

## Problem Statement

Street vendors, a vital part of our economy, frequently encounter significant operational challenges that hinder their growth and stability. These include:

  * **Unreliable Access to Raw Materials:** Inconsistent supply chains and limited options for sourcing quality goods.
  * **Non-Transparent Pricing:** A lack of clear pricing mechanisms, leading to fluctuating costs and potential exploitation.
  * **Lack of Technology for Real-time Vendor Tracking:** Difficulty in tracking material availability and order status, causing inefficiencies.
  * **Absence of a Central System for Group Orders or Trust Validation:** No unified platform for collaborative purchasing or for building trust within the vendor community.

-----

## Solution

**Bazar-Buddy** is a comprehensive, web-based platform designed to revolutionize how street vendors access and manage their raw materials. We aim to empower vendors by providing:

  * **Aggregated Vendors & Raw Materials:** A centralized marketplace connecting vendors with suppliers and materials.
  * **Multilingual, Voice-Based Search:** Intuitive search functionality in local languages, making technology accessible.
  * **UPI-Enabled Ordering & Tracking:** Streamlined digital payments and real-time order monitoring for convenience and transparency.
  * **Verified Delivery Modes and Community-Based Barter/Trade Systems:** Secure delivery options and a robust community feature for resource exchange and mutual support.
